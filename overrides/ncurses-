# notes:
# - I'm not very familiar with ncurses, but it looks like most of the
#   exec here will run hard-coded executables. There's one that is
#   dynamic, but it looks like it only comes from executing a terminfo
#   file, so I think it isn't going to be under user control at the CLI.
#   Happy to have someone help nail this down in either direction!
#   The "capability" is 'iprog', and I could only find 1 real example:
#   https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/terminfo.ti.html#tic-linux-s


# $1 = verdict
# $2 = executable
execer(){
	case "$2" in
		reset|tput|tset)
			if [[ "$1" == "can" ]]; then
				printf "cannot"
			else
				echo "broken assumption: $2 verdict == can" 1>&2
				exit 2
			fi
			;;
		*)
			printf "$1"
			;;
	esac
}
