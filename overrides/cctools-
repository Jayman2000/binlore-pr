# notes:
# - the canonical copy of this is "cctools-", which targets cctools-binutils* and cctools-port*
# - clang-, and gcc- all also symlink to this
# - I am not 100% sure I won't need binutils-, but AFAICT it will only show up as cctools-binutils on macOS, and the macOS definition is the only one we're really targeting

# I guess I'll make one canonical copy as cctools- and then symlink the rest


# IDK if I need bootstrap-tools-, but it'd cover bootstrap-tools/bin/as
